Referral Code & Voucher Sharing App
A simple web application to discover, submit, and manage referral codes and discount vouchers. Built with Next.js and Supabase, designed to be mobile-friendly and easy to maintain.

What I Learned
While building this project, I gained experience with:

Implementing fuzzy search using Supabase RPC functions

Managing structured data in Supabase (services, codes, feedback)

Building a basic admin panel with password protection

Creating feedback logic that disables codes after multiple failure reports

Using the Clipboard API to let users copy codes easily

Writing UI logic for retrying codes, handling copy state, and tracking feedback

Displaying lightweight usage statistics in the frontend

Managing optimistic UI updates for real-time interaction
