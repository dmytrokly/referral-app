# Referral Code & Voucher Sharing App

A simple web application to discover, submit, and manage referral codes and discount vouchers. Built with Next.js and Supabase, it is designed to be mobile-friendly and easy to maintain.

## What I Learned

While building this project, I gained experience with:

- Implementing fuzzy search using Supabase RPC functions
- Managing structured data in Supabase (services, codes, feedback)
- Building a basic admin panel with basic authentication
- Creating feedback logic that disables codes after multiple failure reports
- Using the Clipboard API to let users copy code easily
- Writing UI logic for retrying codes, handling copy state, and tracking feedback
- Displaying lightweight usage statistics in the frontend

## Features
